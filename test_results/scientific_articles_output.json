This comprehensive study evaluates technology-enhanced conservation strategies across 25 marine protected areas worldwide. We deployed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), satellite monitoring, DNA metabarcoding, and AI-powered species identification systems to assess ecosystem health and conservation effectiveness. Results demonstrate that integrated monitoring approaches can increase species detection rates by 340% compared to traditional methods. The study presents a scalable framework for technology-assisted marine conservation that has been successfully implemented in collaboration with local communities and conservation organizations.\", [4].authors=[[4].authors[0]=\"Dr. Ocean Martinez\", [4].authors[1]=\"Prof. Coral Thompson\", [4].authors[2]=\"Dr. Marine Williams\", [4].authors[3]=\"Dr. Deep Singh\"], [4].conservation_outcomes={[4].conservation_outcomes.community_engagement=\"Citizen",
